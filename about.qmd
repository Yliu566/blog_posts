About this blog

This site is previoius built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), now is built with [quarto](https://quarto.org/). 

The first idea of this blog is to put everything I find interesting or useful about Cheminformatics and Machine Learning here. Sometimes the topic will beyond what I just mentioned. Anyway, it just served as a place of notes for my personal usage. Hopefully it turns out nice and clean.
